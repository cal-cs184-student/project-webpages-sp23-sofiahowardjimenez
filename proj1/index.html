        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment I implemented a simple rasterizer with capabilities
          for drawing triangles, supersampling, transforms, and texture mapping.
          The result was a functional graphics renderer that was able to make
          some pretty cool images!
        </p>

        <h2>Task 1</h2>
        <p>
          The first task of the project was to implement basic triangle
          rasterization. In order to do this, I first found the minimum and
          maximum x and y values out of the given three coordinates. These
          values are important because they tell you the corners of the bounding
          box for checking if a given pixel location is within the lines of the
          triangle. I looped through the bounding box by using a double for loop
          with x and y initialized to the minimum respective values. Within the
          loops, I then found whether or not that point was inside the triangle
          by performing the three line test, and if the point was inside the
          triangle, would then call rasterize_point (which I later changed to
          use fill_pixel) on that pixel.
        </p>

        <p>
          This algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the
          bounding box for a triangle because it is performing this algorithm.
        </p>

        <h2>Task 2</h2>
        <p>
          In order to implement supersampling, I updated
          RasterizerImp::set_sample_rate(),
          RasterizerImp::set_framebuffer_target(),
          RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle(), RasterizerImp::fill_pixel(), and
          RasterizerImp::resolve_to_framebuffer().
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I updated set_sample_rate() and set_framebuffer_target() to
          allow for a sample_buffer that could be dynamically sized based off of
          the width, height, and current sample_rate of the renderer. Then, in
          rasterize_triangle, I added two additional for loops to add additional
          sub-pixel points to the loop based off of the square root of the
          sample rate. I also had to update fill_pixel to take in an additional
          index so each entry in the sample buffer has their own index. I also
          had to update resolve_to_framebuffer() as that is where the actual
          averaging of the color values and supersampling takes place before the
          pixel is drawn to the framebuffer.

        <p>
          Supersampling is useful to reduce the prominence of "jaggies" in an
          image and ultimately improve image quality. This was the most
          difficult part of the project for me!

        <p>
          Barycentric coordinates allow us to calculate a point given three
          coordinate values. An easy way to visualize this is to use triangle
          color interpolation.

            As seen in the image to the left, each vertex of the triangle
            represents a different color value, and using barycentric
            coordinates, we can derive every other color as a different weighted
            combination of the three vertices.

        <h2>Task 5</h2>
        <p>
          Pixel sampling is implemented by looking up the position of the
          texture as each pixel is being scanned. Sampling is important because
          textures may not always map 1:1 from the texture space to the world
          space.

        <p>
          In this project, I implemented nearest pixel sampling and bilinear
          sampling:
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearest Sampling uses the color of the texel closest to the pixel
          center, whereas Bilinear Sampling samples the four nearest texels and
          find the weighted average according to the distance between the point
          and the texels.

      <h2>Task 6</h2>
      <p>Level sampling allows us to look at texture spaces that may not have the same size as the world space. We can do this by using mipmaps, which we can think of as
        pyramids of images in descending resolution.
      </p>
      <p>In order to determine the correct mipmap level, we can either sample from Level 0, the nearest Level, or use bilinear sampling on the two nearest levels </p>
