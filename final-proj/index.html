    <h1>Milestone Report</h1>
    <h3>
      Create a short webpage for your milestone report. This should be about 1
      page long if printed. You should briefly summarize what you have
      accomplished, preliminary results, reflect on progress relative to your
      plan, and update your work plan as appropriate. You must submit this
      milestone deliverable (and the final deliverable) on a persistent website
      that you can choose to keep up after class if you wish to present this
      work in your portfolio.

      So far, we have begun to implement cel-shading on top of our project 4
      clothsim implementation by utilizing GLSL fragment shader code. We decided
      to build off project 4 as it already has the shader implementation set up
      for us and thus would only require us to add an additional GLSL fragment
      shader to implement cel-shading for a given mesh. At this point, our
      program is able to output a working version of cel-shading, but it still
      requires some work to touch up the results and make it look more accurate
      to our intended result.

      In order to implement our current results, we started with copying over
      the code from the Phong fragment shader into our new cel-shading GLSL
      fragment shader. We then calculated the light intensity as a float
      representing the dot product between the light position and the normal of
      the input vertex. We then set a number of bins to represent the discrete
      color changes we want to have in our output–currently we are using 4–and
      map the intensity value to one of those color bins. In this
      implementation, we divided our bins into different intensity thresholds,
      with the highest intensity range (from 0.95 to 1 since intensity is
      normalized) being the brightest color bin and the lowest intensity range
      making the darkest color bin. If the intensity is below the lowest
      threshold we have chosen, we set that value to 0, which currently handles
      the outline.

    <p>
      Currently, we are trying to improve the results of our cel-shader, since
      some of our current implementations create dark artifacts on our cloth. In
      completing this write-up, we realized that to calculate the outline we
      should use the camera position instead of the light position, and have
      begun implementing the outlines this way. We are still trying to figure
      out how to import new, more intricate scenes to test our implementation
      on. We also want to be able to change the number of bins we are mapping
      our colors to to create smoother shaded scenes. Finally, we want to be
      able to change the color of the render, as right now we can only produce
      shades of this salmon color.
